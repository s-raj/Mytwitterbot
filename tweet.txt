 Peter Principle
    In every hierarchy, whether it be government or business, each
    employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence; every post

    not-so-good qualities.  In considering our fellow people we
    should remember their good qualities and realize that their
    faults only prove that they are, after all, human.  We should
    refrain from making harsh judgements of people just because
    they happen to be dirty, rotten, no-good sons-of-bitches.

    and T is the number of hours in a work period.
 Professor Gordon's Rule of Evolving Bryographic Systems
    While bryographic plants are typically encountered in
    substrata of earthy or mineral matter in concreted state,
    discrete substrata elements occasionally display a roughly
    spherical configuration which, in presence of suitable
    gravitational and other effects, lends itself to combined
    translatory and rotational motion.  One notices in such cases
    an absence of the otherwise typical accretion of bryophyta.
    We therefore conclude that a rolling stone gathers no moss.
